Some call her crazy
She's still your baby
You'd give her the world
The Cinnamon Girl
(The Cinnamon GIrl)
No name or number
She's undercover
She'll give you the world
The Cinnamon Girl

Boys will be boys
That's a fact of life
Lots of toys and white Knights
Playing games all night
A deadly sin
When you roll the dice
If you let it ride
Win her heart tonight

Some call her crazy
She's still your baby
You'd give her the world
The Cinnamon Girl
(The Cinnamon Girl)
No name or number
She's undercover
She'll give you the world
The Cinnamon Girl

On a rainy night
She's stuck at the state line
Another hour to Vegas
Will they be on time?
A deadly sin
When you roll the dice
If you let it ride
Win her heart tonight

Some call her crazy
She's still your baby
You'd give her the world
The Cinnamon Girl
(The Cinnamon Girl)
No name or number
She's undercover
She'll give you the world
The Cinnamon Girl

Another hour to Vegas
Another hour to Vegas
Another hour to Vegas
Another hour to Vegas
