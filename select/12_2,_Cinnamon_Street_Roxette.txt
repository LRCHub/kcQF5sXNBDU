Growin' up on Cinnamon Street
Everywhere you look there are lots of people to meet
It's seven o'clock, the breakfast treat
Now the school bus is here, hurry up and grab a seat
All the dreams are tiny ones
Another week has just begun
On Cinnamon street

There was a girl on Cinnamon Street
The same age as me, we shared the curiosity
I won her heart, 'cos I could play guitar
Well I promised her Heaven at once and later all the stars
But it all remained the same
(Aah aah)
'Cos things can never change
(Aah aah)
On Cinnamon street

I can hear my heartbeat
The very first time we made love
(Aah aah)
Life was a lazy rest in the sun, ohh oh
Later we went dancin'
Stayin' up all night long
(Aah aah)
Playing all our favourite songs
Cinnamon songs
Woh oh
(Na na na na na)
Woh oh
(Na na)
Woh oh
(Na na na na na)
Woh oh
Yea

I say goodbye to Cinnamon Street
Spring time is here and the air is so dry and sweet
I walk in a cloud, the smell of cinnamon bread
It's in my blood since the day I was born
Til' I wake up, dead
And the sun is smiling gently, a funny shade of red
(Aah aah, aah aah)
Cinnamon street

I still feel my heartbeat
The very first time we made love
Life was a lazy day in the sun ohh oh
(Aah aah)
Later we went dancin'
Hangin' out all night long
(Aah aah)
Singin' all our favourite songs
Cinnamon songs
Woh oh
(Na na na na na)
Woh oh
(Na na)
Woh oh
(Na na na na na)
Woh oh
Yea yea

Singin' cinnamon songs
(Ooh ooh)
(Ooh ooh)
Cinnamon songs
(Ooh ooh)
Yea the cinnamon songs
(Ooh ooh)
